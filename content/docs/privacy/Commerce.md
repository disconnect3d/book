# Privacy

## Intro

This document seeks to outline best practices for privacy and where possible,
anonymity, in our day to day life in our present world where surveillance
capitalisim and app culture are the default.

## Communication

## Transportation

## Discoverability

## Commerce

Imagine you need to pick up something sensitive from a pharmacy. Maybe
pregnancy tests, intimate lubricant, laxitaves, hemorrhoid cream. Maybe you and
your SO wanted to try something new and bought something special from an adult
store. Maybe you just have one secluded coffee shop where no one you know goes,
so you can have some time in your own head.

In all of these, the go-to method of payment is a Visa or Mastercard issued by
a bank or a line of credit tied to your name. Every barcode scanned goes into
a central database of the vendor, and/or a third party. Your bank also gets a
copy of how much you spent, along with the time and location.

These companies all sell data into common dossiers with all the plain text
information they legally can, and auction it off. In cases where pesky data
privacy laws get in the way of selling data directly, they process it first.
Your data goes into advanced prediction engines to make guesses about your
alcohol consumption, diet, religion, political leanings, and what the most
effective ways to manipulate you are. These engines power ad networks
that quite literally sell changes in your behavior as a service.

Let's say for a moment you don't care about any of that. Let's say you trust
Google, Apple, Stripe, Visa, etc would never do anything not in your best
interest and exist only to make your life easier as public servants. Even in
that fictional world, the reality would remain that humans still write the code
that power all of those systems, and every type of company from power plants,
to major banks, to big box stores all get hacked via security oversights, or
negligence.

Now your favorite coffee shop, sex store purchases, pharmacy purchases,
charitable donations, and the daycare you drop your kids off at are all public.

Even if the entity itself does not get hacked, your accounts might be. Banks
will literally hand control of your account over to anyone that asks real
nicely with a social security number they figured out on their own from public
records. If you were born before 2011 in the USA your SSN is based on the
hospital you were born in and those prefixes are public. Even if you were born
after 2011, companies that ask for your SSN get hacked frequently and they are
sold online.

In the United States alone, one out of three pepole experience identity theft
at least once in their lifetimes. Are you feeling lucky?

Protecting the value you work hard to build in this world, and the information
about how you spend it, is one of the most important self defense tactics you
can take in a world where people are more likely to rob you with a phone call
than a knive in a dark alley.

In this chapter we will explore alternatives to Venmo, Cashapp, Paypal, and
credit cards that protect you from those that wish to hurt you for profit.

### Cash

Almost no one uses cash anymore, and there are good reasons for that, but there
are also really important and less obvious reasons we should push through the
drawbacks and use cash everywhere we can.

### Why cash sucks

* Checking out often takes longer
  * It confuses younger generations at checkout counters.
* It requires going to ATMs and Banks frequently to get more of it out
* If you lose it or it is stolen, it is gone forever
* It requires doing math all the time
* Carrying around change is a pain
  * If it bothers you, drop it in the tip jar.

### Why you should use it anyway.

* It requires doing math all the time
  * You will get fast at doing math in your head and it will improve your life.
* It puts limits on how much you can spend
  * And in turn makes you aware of how much you are spending
* It saves businesses 5% in transaction processing fees
  * Ask the owners of local small businesses. Most prefer cash.
    * Paypal charges up to 5% and Square is 3.5%+ on every transaction.
* It avoids any record of who you are, or what you purchased.
  * Records that don't exist don't get stolen or sold
* You can pay your bill and leave any time at a restaurant
  * It is socially acceptable to drop cash and leave. Let them keep the change.
* You can get priority service at bars.
  * Give them a $5 on the first drink and they will take care of you all night

### When cash isn't accepted?

Some parking systems and self-checkouts only take cards. Avoid these when you
can, but sometimes you can't. In these cases having visa gift cards around
you bought anonymously with cash will do the job almost anywhere.
