## Commerce

Imagine you need to pick up something sensitive from a pharmacy. Maybe
pregnancy tests, intimate lubricant, laxitaves, hemorrhoid cream. Maybe you and
your SO wanted to try something new and bought something special from an adult
store. Maybe you just have one secluded coffee shop where no one you know goes,
so you can have some time in your own head.

In all of these, the go-to method of payment is a Visa or Mastercard issued by
a bank or a line of credit tied to your name. Every barcode scanned goes into
a central database of the vendor, and/or a third party. Your bank also gets a
copy of how much you spent, along with the time and location.

These companies all sell data into common dossiers with all the plain text
information they legally can, and auction it off. In cases where pesky data
privacy laws get in the way of selling data directly, they process it first.
Your data goes into advanced prediction engines to make guesses about your
alcohol consumption, diet, religion, political leanings, and what the most
effective ways to manipulate you are. These engines power ad networks
that quite literally sell changes in your behavior as a service.

Let's say for a moment you don't care about any of that. Let's say you trust
Google, Apple, Stripe, Visa, etc would never do anything not in your best
interest and exist only to make your life easier as public servants. Even in
that fictional world, the reality would remain that humans still write the code
that power all of those systems, and every type of company from power plants,
to major banks, to big box stores all get hacked via security oversights, or
negligence.

Now your favorite coffee shop, sex store purchases, pharmacy purchases,
charitable donations, and the daycare you drop your kids off at are all public.

Even if the entity itself does not get hacked, your accounts might be. Banks
will literally hand control of your account over to anyone that asks real
nicely with a social security number they figured out on their own from public
records. If you were born before 2011 in the USA your SSN is based on the
hospital you were born in and those prefixes are public. Even if you were born
after 2011, companies that ask for your SSN get hacked frequently and they are
sold online.

In the United States alone, one out of three pepole experience identity theft
at least once in their lifetimes. Are you feeling lucky?

Protecting the value you work hard to build in this world, and the information
about how you spend it, is one of the most important self defense tactics you
can take in a world where people are more likely to rob you with a phone call
than a knive in a dark alley.

In this chapter we will explore alternatives to Venmo, Cashapp, Paypal, and
credit cards that protect you from those that wish to hurt you for profit.

### Cash

Almost no one uses cash anymore, and there are good reasons for that, but there
are also really important and less obvious reasons we should push through the
drawbacks and use cash everywhere we can.

#### Why cash sucks

* Checking out often takes longer
  * It confuses younger generations at checkout counters.
* It requires going to ATMs and Banks frequently to get more of it out
* If you lose it or it is stolen, it is gone forever
* It requires doing math all the time
* Carrying around change is a pain
  * If it bothers you, drop it in the tip jar.

#### Why you should use it anyway.

* It requires doing math all the time
  * You will get fast at doing math in your head and it will improve your life.
* It puts limits on how much you can spend
  * And in turn makes you aware of how much you are spending
* It saves businesses 5% in transaction processing fees
  * Ask the owners of local small businesses. Most prefer cash.
    * Paypal charges up to 5% and Square is 3.5%+ on every transaction.
* It avoids any record of who you are, or what you purchased.
  * Records that don't exist don't get stolen or sold
* You can pay your bill and leave any time at a restaurant
  * It is socially acceptable to drop cash and leave. Let them keep the change.
* You can get priority service at bars.
  * Give them a $5 on the first drink and they will take care of you all night

#### When cash isn't accepted?

Some parking systems and self-checkouts only take cards. Avoid these when you
can, but sometimes you can't. In these cases having visa gift cards around
you bought anonymously with cash will do the job almost anywhere.


### Bitcoin

Many readers cringe the moment they saw this as a title, and there are some
real drawbacks of Bitcoin, but there are also many cases where it is the most
private, practical, and green way to make a purchase while protecting your
privacy.

If you are reading this, you are probably not sold on using Bitcoin as an
actual currency yet, but we hope to make a fair case, and in turn we ask that
you set aside a lot of the misinformed propaganda you hear on the topic and
digest some irrefutable facts and informed opinons we have to share.

Other readers here are screaming "What about Monero, ZCash, and X random coin".

Well, yes, those exist, but Bitcoin is currently the only cryptoasset with any
useful level of adoption in commerce. If you are aware of a niche vendor that
accepts Monero, then you don't need us to tell you that is a neat option.

#### Why people think Bitcoin sucks

* It uses a lot of energy
  * 70% of bitcoin use is green energy
  * Increasingly common Layer 2 solutions like Lightning use negligable energy.
* Only the rich can afford a Bitcoin
  * You don't need to buy a whole Bitcoin. You can buy $5 worth if you like.
* It is volatile
  * So are stocks, as anyone owning TSLA or TWTR can attest.
  * Bitcoin has wildly outpreformed the dollar for over a decade.
  * It will never inflate by design, unlike the 8%+ annual loss in USD
    * Inflation is a major source of economic pain and inequality.
      * See: https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/
* It is used for terrorism, fraud, and money laundering
  * Fiat currency is used even more often for the same things.
  * Highways are used for human trafficking.
  * The internet is used to spread child porn.
  * Cooking knives are used to murder people.
* You are screwed if it gets lost or stolen.
  * If you can avoid losing country identity documents, you can store btc.
    * You can store your bitcoin wallet:
      * In your brain
      * On paper as 24 words
      * In an NFC ring, or implant
      * On many sheets of paper spread across many locations
    * You can share access with people you trust
      * Multi-sig wallets allow multiple people to share wallet access
      * You can permit spending only if only one or multiple parties agree.
* It has no privacy because all exchanges do KYC/AML.
  * You can trade Bitcoin for Monero then for Bitcoin again for high privacy.
  * You can buy from an ATM or a peer-to-peer source instead
  * You can have employers, clients, and friends settle debts with you in BTC.

#### Why Bitcoin actually sucks

* Most popular storage options have terrible security.
* Most secure storage options have a steep learning curve
* Bitcoin ATMs are only common in major metropolitan areas
* Not many businesses accept it yet
* Any government could shut it down if they really wanted to.
* It is written in a language that make security mistakes easy
* There is very little implementation diversity
* Most nodes are deployed with terrible security practices
* Most nodes are slow to apply upgrades and patches

#### Why you should use it anyway

* Many online vendors allow only Paypal or Bitcoin.
  * Bitcoin is normally lower fees and preserves privacy
* Anonymously purchased BTC can preserve your privacy when spending.
* You can hide it much more easily than cash
  * A real problem in developing countries or for homeless individuals.
* Buying incrementally with dollar cost averaging beats savings accounts.
  * Modern savings accounts make negative interest when considering inflation
  * Bitcoin is deflationary by design and not vulnerable to this problem
* A false court accusation can't get your wallet frozen or drained
* Governments can't easily seize a wallet stored in your brain.
* No one can easily prove you even have a self custodial Bitcoin wallet.
* Properly stored Bitcoin can't be stolen by identity theft
  * Proper storage:
    * Checking: Mobile phone app with amount you can afford to lose
    * Savings: Multisig "cold wallet" using hardware wallet devices
