This section documents 6 security fundamentals:

1. Ensuring Data Integrity (Checksum)
2. Creating Safe Representations of Arbitrary Data (Hashing)
3. Securing Data using a Common Passphrase (Symmetric Encryption)
4. Securing Data over Insecure Channels (Asymmetric Encryption)
5. Message Authentication by Shared Keys (HMAC)
6. Authenticating Messages using a Known Public Key (Signing)

There is also a section, Applied Cryptography, which shows how all of these
methods can be used in an application.
